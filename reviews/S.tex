\movie{Samsara}{2011}{102m}{\four} \dir{Ron Fricke} A non-narrative film that pulls together a vast array of footage from twenty-five countries and five continents, transporting viewers to sacred grounds, disaster zones, industrial complexes, and natural wonders. A stunning visual feast (shot on 70mm film) and touching portrait of humanity and nature, \textit{Samsara} forces us to consider both the unspeakable ugliness and breathtaking beauty in the world, and to examine our role in both. Backed by an excellent score influenced by music around the world. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

Strong drama focusing on how both characters influence each other lives has many touching scenes.

\movie{Shot in the Dark, A}{1964}{102m}{\threehalf} \dir{Blake Edwards} \cast{Peter Sellers; Elke Sommer; George Sanders; Herbert Lom; Tracy Reed; Graham Stark; Moira Redmond} As murder follows murder, beautiful Maria is the obvious suspect, but bumbling Inspector Clouseau sees her as plainly innocent. Hilarious follow-up to \textit{The Pink Panther} has Sellers introducing his idiosyncratic French accent to the Clouseau character. Funniest and most memorable scene: Clouseau and Maria inadvertently find themselves in a nudist colony. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG, 1975}

\movie{Side by Side}{2012}{98m}{\three} \dir{Christopher Kenneally} \cast{James Cameron; David Fincher; David Lynch; Robert Rodriguez; Martin Scorsese; Steven Soderbergh; Christopher Nolan; Keanu Reeves} Documentary exploring the ``science, art, and impact'' of digital cinema and its effects on the industry as the era of movies on 35mm film comes to an end.

Relentlessly suspenseful and scary thriller is masterfully directed by Demme and not for the faint of heart. Hopkins gives a chilling performance as Dr.\ Hannibal Lecter, one of cinema's most memorable antagonists. One of three films to win the ``Big Five'' Academy Awards. From the novel by Thomas Harris. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

Russell} \cast{Bradley Cooper; Jennifer Lawrence; Robert De Niro; Jacki Weaver; Chris Tucker; Anupam Kher; John Ortiz} After a brief stint in a mental institution, Pat Solitano teams up with the equally crazy Tiffany Maxwell in a dance competition in an attempt to win back his estranged wife. Passionate and authentic performances from Lawrence and Cooper in this entertaining, witty romantic comedy-drama that gives a fresh breath of life to the jaded genre and reminds us that sometimes sanity can be entirely subjective. Nominated in all four acting categories at the 85\th\ Academy Awards. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Skeleton Key, The}{2005}{104m}{\two} \dir{Iain Softley} \cast{Kate Hudson; Gena Rowlands; John Hurt; Peter Sarsgaard; Joy Bryant} A hospice nurse working at a spooky New Orleans plantation home finds herself entangled in a mystery involving the house's dark past. A forgettable and not-too-scary supernatural thriller with a formulaic script and lackluster acting. A few creepy scenes, but overall the film falls flat. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Skyfall}{2012}{143m}{\threehalf} \dir{Sam Mendes} \cast{Daniel Craig; Judi Dench; Javier Bardem; Ralph Fiennes; Naomie Harris; B\'er\'enice Marlohe; Ben Whishaw} 50\th-anniversary James Bond film has MI6 under attack, and Bond and M are pitted against an estranged former MI6 agent out for revenge.

Craig's third film as Bond and Dench's last as M\@. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

Mankiewicz} \cast{Laurence Olivier; Michael Caine; Alec Cawthorne} A man who loves games and theater invites his wife's lover to meet him at his grand mansion, setting up a battle of wits with potentially deadly results. An excellent mystery thriller whose string of successive plot twists will keeep even the most experienced mystery fan guessing. Intense and convincing performances from both of the two stars, who for the majority of the film, are the only two actors on screen. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Snow Day}{2000}{89m}{\half} \dir{Chris Koch} \cast{Chevy Chase; Chris Elliott; Mark Webber; Schuyler Fisk; Jean Smart; Emmanuelle Chriqui; Zena Gray} When a school in upstate New York is snowed in, a group of students hijack a snowplow to keep the school closed. Unfunny and stupid comedy with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. A complete waste of time. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Social Network, The}{2010}{120m}{\threehalf} \dir{David Fincher} \cast{Jesse Eisenberg; Andrew Garfield; Justin Timberlake; Armie Hammer; Max Minghella; Brenda Song; Rooney Mara} Chronicles the early days of Facebook and the lawsuits its creator Mark Zuckerberg later faces, from two brothers who claimed he stole their idea as well as the co-founder who was squeezed out of the business. A well-made, modern, fast-paced film with a stellar screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. The performances and the musical score are memorable as well. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

Carroll; Rhonda Fleming} A psychiatrist protects an amnesiac while attempting to uncover mysteries of a murder which he is accused of committing. Perhaps one of the lesser-acknowledged Hitchcock features, elements of surrealism, suspense, and film noir blend amazingly well in this exciting thriller. Notable is the dircting, acting from the two leads (Bergmand and Peck), and a twisty dream sequency by Salvador Dali. \author{AW}

\movie{Splice}{2009}{104m}{\twohalf} \dir{Vincenzo Natali} \cast{Adrien Brody; Sarah Polley; Delphine Chan\'eac; Brandon McGibbon; Simona Maicanescu; David Hewlett; Abigail Chu} Two genetic engineers splice together DNA of different animals to create new hybrid animals for medical use, but run into unforseen problems when they incorporate human DNA. A weird, grotesque, and unique sci-fi horror film with a thought-provoking premise. Sometimes humorous, sometimes genuinely creepy, but the film does suffer from lackluster acting and should have explored its premise further. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

Special edition runs 135m. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans}{1927}{95m}{\four} \dir{F.W. Murnau} \cast{George O'Brien; Janet Gaynor; Margaret Livingston} This film won awards at the 1\st\ annual Academy Awards. A married farmer is convinced by a woman from the city to sell his farm and drown his wife. The nameless characters seem to be archetypes of figures larger than life.

Symbols: the city, the boat, day/night, the sunrise. \author{AW}
