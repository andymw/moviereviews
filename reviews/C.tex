\movie{Casablanca}{1942}{142m}{\four} \dir{Michael Curtiz} \cast{Humphrey Bogart; Ingrid Bergman; Paul Henreid} Set in unoccupied Africa during World War II, an American named Rick Blaine inadvertently encounters his former Norwegian lover, Ilsa Lund, with consequences. \textit{Casablanca} eloquently conveys the importance of politics over other issues (such as love) in times of war, the American dream of freedom, how choosing a side in politics and love is unavoidable and necessary, and how beautiful and haunting the past can be. Won Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 1943. \author{AW}

\movie{Captain Phillips}{2013}{134m}{\four} \dir{Paul Greengrass} \cast{Tom Hanks; Barkhad Abdi; Barkhad Abdirahman; Faysal Ahmed; Mahat M. Ali; Catherine Keener; Michael Chernus} \author{} Biopic on Captain Richard Phillips, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean during the \textit{Maersk Alabama} hijacking of 2009. This edge-of-your-seat action thriller features brilliant acting by Hanks and Abdi and packs a surprisingly emotional punch at the ending. Like Greengrass' also excellent \textit{United 93}, it's a humbling film to watch as an American. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Cast Away}{2000}{143m}{\three} \dir{Robert Zemeckis} \cast{Tom Hanks; Helen Hunt; Nick Searcy; Jenifer Lewis; Chris Noth; Lari White} A FedEx executive must transform himself physically and emotionally to survive a plane crash landing on a deserted island. Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance in this flawed, but engrossing survival drama. We see his character teeter back and forth at the edge of desolation and despair as he struggles to maintain hope and humanity. Good direction by Zemeckis. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Children of Men}{2006}{109m}{\threehalf} \dir{Alfonso Cuar\'on} \cast{Clive Owen; Julianne Moore; Michael Caine; Claire-Hope Ashitey; Chiwetel Ejiofor; Pam Ferris; Peter Mullan} In a dystopian 2027 in which humans can no longer reproduce, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman out of the country. A thrilling and cautionary science-fiction film that's marvelously acted and directed. Excellent cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki involving several long, difficult action-filled takes. Themes include hope, faith, and violence.  \author{DW} \mpaa{R} 

\movie{Chitty Chitty Bang Bang}{1968}{144m}{\twohalf} \dir{Ken Hughes} \cast{Dick Van Dyke; Sally Ann Howes; Adrian Hall; Heather Ripley; Lionel Jeffries; Gert Fr\"obe; Anna Quayle} A hapless inventor finally finds success with a flying car, which a dictator from a foreign government sets out to take for himself. An entertaining musical fantasy for children, but the songs (except for the title song) are mediocre and non-memorable. Van Dyke's failed inventions are a hilarious highlight. \author{DW} \mpaa{G}

\movie{Circus, The}{1928}{71m}{\threehalf} \dir{Charlie Chaplin} \cast{Charlie Chaplin; Al Ernest Garcia; Merna Kennedy; Harry Crocker; George Davis; Henry Bergman} The Tramp finds work at a circus (after a hilarious sequence of incidents at the beginning of the film) and falls for the ringmaster's step-daughter, a circus rider. Chaplin's last film in which he ``does not get the girl.'' Despite having one of the saddest endings of a Chaplin film, \textit{The Circus} is nonetheless one of Chaplin's purely hilarious features, including a wonderful must-see opening sequence. \author{AW} \mpaa{G, 1969}

\movie{Citizen Kane}{1941}{119m}{\fourplus} \dir{Orson Welles} \cast{Orson Welles; Joseph Cotten; Dorothy Comingore; Everett Sloane; Agnes Moorehead; Ruth Warrick} The death of Charles Foster Kane, the world's biggest newspaper tycoon, prompts journalists to try and discover the meaning of the man's last words to no avail. \textit{Kane} excels on every aspect of filmmaking, from acting, direction, and script to visual effects (forced perspective), cinematography (deep focus, lighting, extreme angles), music, and editing (cuts and passes that signify the passage of time). A movie that must be seen again and again for its intricacies and subtleties. \author{AW} \mpaa{PG, 1991}

\movie{City Lights}{1931}{87m}{\fourplus} \dir{Charlie Chaplin} \cast{Charlie Chaplin; Virginia Cherrill; Harry Myers; Florence Lee; Al Ernest Garcia; Henry Bergman} Chaplin makes his greatest film entry as the Tramp snoozing on a newly-constructed city statue. He meets a lonely blond flower girl who mistakes him for a millionaire. The Tramp struggles to make money for the girl's eye operation. With perhaps the most moving closing scene in film, \textit{City Lights} is Charlie Chaplin's greatest masterpiece. Themes: love is blind, the dissociation between wealth and happiness. Motifs and symbols: sight, recognition through touch, mistaken identity, flowers. \author{AW}

\movie{Close Encounters of the Third Kind}{1977}{135m}{\threehalf} \dir{Steven Spielberg} \cast{Richard Dreyfuss; Fran\c{c}ois Truffaut; Melinda Dillon; Teri Garr; Bob Balaban; Josef Sommer; Lance Henriksen} After an encouter with UFOs, a line worker feels mysteriously drawn to an isolated area where something spectacular is about to happen. Classic sci-fi adventure that's exciting, mystical, and filled with great special effects. Dreyfuss gives an especially effective performance. Director's cut runs 137m. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Conjuring, The}{2013}{112m}{\three} \dir{James Wan} \cast{Patrick Wilson; Vera Farmiga; Ron Livingston; Lili Taylor; Shanley Caswell; Hayley McFarland; Joey King} Based on the real-life events of ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren investigating a particularly disturbing haunting in 1971 Rhode Island. A tense and relentlessly scary supernatural horror film and a fine effort from \textit{Saw} director James Wan. Proves that ``old-fashioned'' suspense and off-screen horrors can be much more effective than digital blood and gore. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Contagion}{2011}{106m}{\twohalf} \dir{Steven Soderbergh} \cast{Marion Cotillard; Matt Damon; Laurence Fishburne; Jude Law; Gwyneth Paltrow; Kate Winslet} An international team of medical experts from the CDC and WHO team up to control the spread of a deadly virus. This tense and frightening thriller capitalizes on our fear of infectious disease, but Soderbergh's ``hyperlink narrative'' style leaves more to be desired in regards to plot and character development. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Conversation, The}{1974}{113m}{\four} \dir{Francis Ford Coppola} \cast{Gene Hackman; John Cazale; Allen Garfield; Cindy Williams; Frederic Forrest; Harrison Ford; Michael Higgins; Elizabeth MacRae} A surveillance expert has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered. An excellent thriller written and directed by Coppola, that's paranoid, smart, and features an excellent performance by Hackman. Its profound statements on technology's role in society still resonate strongly today. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Crazy, Stupid, Love.}{2011}{118m}{\twohalf} \dir{Glenn Ficarra; John Requa} \cast{Steve Carell; Ryan Gosling; Juilanne Moore; Emma Stone; Analeigh Tipton; Jonah Bobo; Joey King} After he learns his wife wants a divorce, middle-aged family man Cal Weaver's rediscovers his bachelorhood with the help of his new friend and wingman, while his tweenage son tries to win over his babysitter. A good-natured and entertaining romantic comedy, but some of its characters, especially the teenage ones, are too exaggerated to elicit any empathy. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}
