\movie{Zathura}{2005}{113m}{\twohalf} \dir{Jon Favreau} \cast{Josh Hutcherson; Jonah Bobo; Dax Shepard; Kristen Stewart; Tim Robbins} Two young brothers wind up on an intergalactic adventure when their house is hurled through space by the magical board game they are playing. A decent adventure film that will undoubtedly be entertaining for children, but may not be enough to hold adults' interest. Its two young stars are confident and strong in their roles. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Zero Dark Thirty}{2012}{157m}{\four} \dir{Kathryn Bigelow} \cast{Jessica Chastain; Jason Clarke; Joel Edgerton; Mark Strong; Jennifer Ehle; Kyle Chandler} This intense chronicle follows a smart and underestimated CIA officer Maya in her eight-year hunt for Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden and her personal transformation in the process. Chastain gives a nuanced performance as Maya. Themes: a woman's place/power in a male-dominated world. (In one of the best exchanges in the film: ``What do you think of the girl?''/``I think she's smart.''/``We're all smart.'') Thrilling and moving, Bigelow passionately directs one of the best films of 2012. \author{AW} \mpaa{R}
