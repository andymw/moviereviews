\movie{Da Vinci Code, The}{2006}{149m}{\two} \dir{Ron Howard} \cast{Tom Hanks; Audrey Tautou; Ian McKellen; Jean Reno; Paul Bettany; Alfred Molina} Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon investigates a murder at the Louvre and discovers clues in Da Vinci's paintings leading to a religious mystery protected by a secret society. The plot is long and meandering, and difficult to understand having not read the novel first. Paul Bettany gives a good performance as villain Silas. Extended cut runs 174m. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Dark Knight, The}{2008}{152m}{\four} \dir{Christopher Nolan} \cast{Christian Bale; Heath Ledger; Aaron Eckhart; Michael Caine; Maggie Gyllenhaal; Gary Oldman; Morgan Freeman} Crime-fighters Batman, Gordon, and Harvey Dent launch a crusade against the lawless mobs in Gotham City, only to provoke The Joker, a sadistic villian intent on turning Gotham against itself. Excellent blockbuster that explores big-city crime and the minds and motivations of those on both sides of it. Ledger's incredible performance as The Joker was immortalized by his untimely death shortly after filming wrapped. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Dark Knight Rises, The}{2012}{165m}{\three} \dir{Christopher Nolan} \cast{Christian Bale; Gary Oldman; Tom Hardy; Joseph Gordon-Levitt; Anne Hathaway; Marion Cotillard; Morgan Freeman} Eight years after \textit{The Dark Knight}, Batman resurfaces to protect Gotham from a new terrorist leader, Bane. Good action film, with most of the fine cast reprising their roles from the earlier films. Heath Ledger's Joker is sorely missed; Bane just doesn't bring the same fascinating depravity that made the previous film so outstanding. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Days of Heaven}{1978}{94m}{\four} \dir{Terrence Malick} \cast{Richard Gere; Brooke Adams; Sam Shepard; Linda Manz} Set in 1916. Bill (Gere) and Abby (Adams), two poor lovers, travel to the Texas Panhandle to harvest crops for a wealthy dying farmer (Shepard). A series of unfortunate events happen after Bill encourages Abby to marry the farmer for his fortune. A haunting, strange, and atmospheric film, characterized by beautiful innovative cinematography (typical of Malick). \author{AW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Dead Poets Society}{1989}{128m}{\threehalf} \dir{Peter Weir} \cast{Robin Williams; Robert Sean Leonard; Ethan Hawke; Josh Charles; Gale Hanson; Norman Lloyd; Kurtwood Smith} Through his unconventional but passionate teaching methods, English teacher John Keating instills a love of poetry in his students at an all-male boarding school and inspires them to ``seize the day'' and live life to the fullest. Moving and intelligent drama about courage and following one's ambitions, with an exceptional performance by Williams. The film succeeds in inspiring the same \textit{carpe diem} message in its audience that Keating impresses upon his students. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Die Hard}{1988}{131m}{\threehalf} \dir{John McTiernan} \cast{Bruce Willis; Alan Rickman; Alexander Godunov; Bonnie Bedelia; Reginald VelJohnson; Paul Gleason} NYPD officer John McClane fights several heavily armed German terrorists to save his wife and several hostages in L.A. after the bad guys sieze the 40-story Nakatomi Plaza during a Christmas party. Exciting and riveting action thriller with tons of dramatic firefights between McClane, the terrorists, and L.A. police. Rickman is excellent as terrorist leader Hans Gruber. The story is formulaic and the characters one-dimensional, but who cares?---the movie is fun anyway! \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Django Unchained}{2012}{165m}{\threehalf} \dir{Quentin Tarantino} \cast{Jamie Foxx; Christoph Waltz; Leonardo DiCaprio; Kerry Washington; Samuel L. Jackson; Walton Goggins; Dennis Christopher} In the antebellum South, feed slave Django teams up with a bounty hunter as he sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner. Tarantino's ultraviolent spaghetti western is a darkly humorous and satisfying revenge tale; may be too excessive and overindulgent for some tastes. Good cinematography by Robert Richardson. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Domestic Disturbance}{2001}{89m}{\onehalf} \dir{Harold Becker} \cast{John Travolta; Vince Vaughn; Teri Polo; Matt O'Leary; Steve Buscemi; James Lashly; Rebecca Tilney} A divorced father discovers that his 12-year-old son's new stepfather is not what he made himself out to be. Extremely predictable thriller builds suspense in the first half but becomes completely dull in the second. The characters are dull and uninteresting, but at least the acting is OK. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Donnie Darko}{2001}{113m}{\three} \dir{Richard Kelly} \cast{Jake Gyllenhaal; Jena Malone; Mary McDonnell; Holmes Osborne; Katharine Ross; Maggie Gyllenhaal; Daveigh Chase; Drew Barrymore; Patrick Swayze} A troubled teenager is plagued by visions of a large rabbit that manipulates him to commit a series of crimes, after narrowly escaping a bizarre accident. A unique and genre-bending vision from writer-director Kelly that's confusing yet intriguing, and probably deserves multiple viewings. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a remarkably convincing performance as the title character. Director's cut offering more explanation to the story's fantastical elements runs 133m. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}
