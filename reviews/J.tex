\movie{Jaws}{1975}{124m}{\four} \dir{Steven Spielberg} \cast{Roy Scheider; Robert Shaw; Richard Dreyfuss; Lorraine Gary; Murray Hamilton; Carl Gottlieb} When a great white shark begins to terrorize the resort island of Amity, a local police chief, ichthyologist, and fisherman set out to stop it. The quintessential summer blockbuster, \textit{Jaws} is a relentlessly suspenseful and thrilling adventure film that still manages to keep moviegoers out of the water. An excellent cast, unforgettable score, and masterful direction by Spielberg make this a film that will never be outdated. Followed by a chain of inferior sequels. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Juno}{2007}{96m}{\two} \dir{Jason Reitman} \cast{Ellen Page; Michael Cera; Jennifer Garner; Jason Bateman; Allison Janney; J.K. Simmons; Olivia Thirlby} Faced with an unplanned pregnancy, an offbeat young woman makes an unusual decision regarding her unborn child. Offbeat and occasionally funny drama-comedy that has decent performances, but a script so zany it's hard to believe some of those lines would actually be spoken by anyone. As a result, the characters seem more like caricatures, an approach which works for some films, but not this one. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}
