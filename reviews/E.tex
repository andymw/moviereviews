\movie{Eroica}{2003}{84m}{\three} \dir{Simon Cellan Jones} \cast{Ian Hart; Tim Pigott-Smith; Jack Davenport; Fenella Woolgar; Claire Skinner; Lucy Akhurst; Frank Finlay} A BBC television film centered on the first private performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's monumental and controversial third symphony, ``Eroica,'' for his patron Prince Lobkowitz. Featuring an excellent full performance of the work led by John Eliot Gardiner, the symphony itself is the centerpiece of the film, with minimal dialogue interlaced with the performance to provide historical context to Beethoven's work. Cinematography is a bit dizzying at times, but reflects the passion and intensity in the symphony. \author{DW}
