\movie{Kicking \& Screaming}{2005}{95m}{\two} \dir{Jesse Dylan} \cast{Will Ferrell; Robert Duvall; Mike Ditka; Kate Walsh; Musetta Vander; Dylan McLaughlin; Josh Hutcherson} Family man Phil Weston takes on the coaching duties of a kids' soccer team, and soon finds that he's also taking on his father's dysfunctional way of relating. A mediocre sports comedy with a spirited performance by Ferrell, but an immature script that's too heavy on unfunny jokes and too light on story. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Kid, The}{1921}{68m}{\four} \dir{Charlie Chaplin} \cast{Charlie Chaplin; Edna Purviance; Jackie Coogan; Henry Bergman; Lita Grey} Chaplin's first full-length movie. When a woman abandons her newborn son, the Tramp stumbles upon the baby and, being unable to abandon him, cares for him. Five years later, the relationship is put in jeopardy when the kid's regretful mother rediscovers him. A powerful and touching comedy-drama by Charlie Chaplin, and one of the near-perfect masterpieces of the silent era. Features a marvelous performance by Jackie Coogan, who was then only six years old. \author{AW}

\movie{King Kong}{2005}{187m}{\three} \dir{Peter Jackson} \cast{Naomi Watts; Jack Black; Adrien Brody; Thomas Kretschmann; Collin Hanks; Andy Serkis} In 1933 New York, an ambitious movie producer coerces his cast and crew to travel to the mysterious Skull Island, where they meet Kong, a giant ape who immediately falls for the leading lady Ann Darrow. A sweeping epic with state-of-the-art special effects and a strong cast, Jackson's marathon remake of the 1933 original is a satisfying spectacle, but should have been trimmed down by about a half-hour. (Extended cut runs 201m!) \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{King's Speech, The}{2010}{118m}{\four} \dir{Tom Hooper} \cast{Colin Firth; Geoffrey Rush; Helena Bonham Carter; Guy Pearce; Timothy Spall; Derek Jacobi; Michael Gambon} Based on the true story of Britain's King George VI and his speech therapist who helped him overcome a severe studder after his ascension to the throne. An inspirational, feel-good historical drama extremely well acted by Firth and Rush. Features great cinematography, music, and costumes, and the triumphant final scene in which King George delivers his first radio speech is unforgettable. Won Oscar for Best Picture. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Koyaanisqatsi}{1982}{86m}{\fourplus} \dir{Godfrey Reggio} A non-narrative film composed of a collection of slow-motion and time-lapse shots of humans, clouds, cities, deserts, technology, and machienery. Its title meaning ``life out of balance'' in the Hopi language, this film explores the fact that humans are living a life that is out of balance with the rest of nature. Beautifully photographed and featuring one of the greatest film scores of all time from Minimalism pioneer Philip Glass, \textit{Koyaanisqatsi} offers a deeply profound, moving experience for its viewers. \author{DW}
