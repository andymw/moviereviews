\movie{Pan's Labyrinth}{2006-Spanish}{118m}{\four} \dir{Guillermo del Toro} \cast{Ivana Baquero; Sergi L\'opez; Maribel Verd\'u; Doug Jones; Ariadna Gil; \'Alex Angulo} In 1944 fascist Spain, a young girl is sent to live with her sadistic army-captain stepfather, where a mythical faun takes her to a mysterious land. A dark and grotesque fantasy, del Toro's ``fairy tale for adults'' is an excellent, brilliantly acted piece of filmmaking that explores the link between reality and imagination, coping with hardship, and the horrors of war. Combination of CGI and animatronics results in a fantasy world as real as the live-action sequences. Spanish title is \textit{El laberinto del fauno}. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Pi}{1998}{84m}{\three} \dir{Darren Aronofsky} \cast{Sean Gullette; Mark Margolis; Ben Shenkman; Samia Shoaib; Pamela Hart; Stephen Perlman} Paranoid mathematician Max Cohen searches for a key number that will unlock the universal patterns found in nature. A unique and distinctly independent psychological thriller, writer/director Aronofsky's first feature proves that big things can be done with a small budget. The film's frenetic, grainy black-and-white cinematography draws us deepy into Max's surreal and bizarre world. Themes include order vs.\ chaos, genius, sanity, and obsession. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Pinocchio}{1940}{88m}{\four} \dir{Ben Sharpsteen; Hamilton Luske; Norman Ferguson; T. Hee; Wilfred Jackson; Jack Kinney; Bill Roberts} An old woodworker named Geppetto wishes that his marionette, Pinocchio, could be a real boy. Blue Fairy grants his wish, and Pinocchio learns of conscience, temptations, and what it means to be a good boy (by being truthful, brave, and unselfish) with the help of Jiminy Cricket. The second theatrical animated Disney film is haunting, touching, expressive, and deserves to be seen by children and adults alike. Based on the story \textit{The Adventures of Pinocchio} by Carlo Collodi. \author{AW}

\movie{Pitch Perfect}{2012}{112m}{\twohalf} \dir{Jason Moore} \cast{Anna Kendrick; Rebel Wilson; Skylar Astin; Brittany Snow; Anna Camp; Ben Platt} College freshman Beca joins all-female a capella group The Bellas, injecting some much-needed energy into their repertoire and competing against their male rival group in the ICCA inter-collegiate competition. With catchy songs and good performances overall, this fun comedy occasionally suffers from its over-the-top, exaggerated script. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Psycho}{1960}{109m}{\four} \dir{Alfred Hitchcock} \cast{Anthony Perkins; Vera Miles; Janet Leigh; John Gavin; Martin Balsam; John McIntire} A young woman on the run after stealing \$40,000 from her employer's client stumbles upon the Bates Motel, run by a quiet inkeeper who is unhealthily dominated by his mother. One of the most famous horror films (especially for its iconic ``shower scene''), this classic is still effective and scary today, thanks to Hitchcock's brilliant ``less is more'' directing. Features a chilling score and an unforgettable performance by Perkins as the ``psycho'' Norman Bates. \author{DW} \mpaa{R, 1984}
