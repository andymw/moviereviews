\movie{Inception}{2010}{148m}{\four} \dir{Christopher Nolan} \cast{Leonardo DiCaprio; Joseph Gordon-Levitt; Ellen Page; Tom Hardy; Ken Watanabe; Dileep Rao; Cillian Murphy; Marion Cotillard; Michael Caine} In a world where technology exists to enter the human mind through dream invasion, a highly skilled thief must perform his toughest job to date: Inception. Intelligent and innovative psychological action film that is as mentally stimulating as it is exciting. Nolan worked on the script for ten years; his diligent attention to detail makes this film shine. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Inglourious Basterds}{2009}{153m}{\threehalf} \dir{Quentin Tarantino} \cast{Brad Pitt; M\'elanie Laurent; Christoph Waltz; Eli Roth; Michael Fassbender; Diane Kruger; Daniel Br\"uhl} In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders by a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers coincides with a theatre owner's vengeful plans for the same. Entertaining and stylistic alternate history war film featuring a masterful performance by Waltz (speaking at least three languages). The first scene is near-perfect; a few others drag on a bit long, but overall a thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Insidious}{2010}{103m}{\two} \dir{James Wan} \cast{Patrick Wilson; Rose Byrne; Ty Simpkins; Andrew Astor; Barbara Hershey; Lin Shaye} A family is forced to ward off evil spirits attempting to possess their son after they move to an old house where the young boy enters a catatonic state. Starts out strong, but the second half of the movie doesn't live up to the first. \textit{Insidious} delivers a few ``jump'' scares, but there's not enough new material to satisfy fans of the genre. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{It's a Wonderful Life}{1946}{130m}{\four} \dir{Frank Capra} \cast{James Stewart; Donna Reed; Lionel Barrymore; Henry Travers} On Christmas Eve, George Bailey (Stewart), a frustrated businessman in Bedford Falls, New York, is shown what life would be been like for the people around him if he never were born. We see flashbacks of him in high school and college, getting married to his dream girl Mary (Reed), and raising a family. An incredibly moving film about the appreciation and meaningfulness of life, friends, and family. This classic film never loses its magic, even after repeated Christmas-time viewings. \author{AW} \mpaa{PG, 2012}
