\movie{Les Mis\'erables}{2012}{157m}{\three} \dir{Tom Hooper} \cast{Hugh Jackman; Russell Crowe; Anne Hathaway; Amanda Seyfried; Sacha Baron Cohen; Helena Bonham Carter; Eddie Redmayne; Samantha Barks} Ex-prisoner Jean Valjean breaks his parole and agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter, while he is chased by relentless policeman Javert across 19\th-century revolutionary France. Based on the popular musical of the same name. Great performances from the ensemble cast, especially Hathaway's ``I Dreamed a Dream,'' but director Hooper tends to shove the camera down his actors' throats, and the pacing would have benefitted from an intermission after ``One Day More.'' \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Life of Pi}{2012}{127m}{\four} \dir{Ang Lee} \cast{Suraj Sharma; Adil Hussain; Tabu; Irrfan Khan; Rafe Spall; Ayush Tandon; Vibish Sivakumar; Mohamed Abbas Khaleeli} A faith-driven young Indian man is shipwrecked and finds himself alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger in the Pacific ocean. A beautiful, emotional adventure film that explores themes of survival, hope, faith, truth, and courage. 3D visual and special effects are outstanding and breathtaking. Ang Lee succeeds in creating an incredible movie from the ``unfilmable'' novel by Yann Martel. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Limelight}{1952}{137m}{\threehalf} \dir{Charlie Chaplin} \cast{Charlie Chaplin; Claire Bloom; Buster Keaton; Sydney Chaplin} Set in 1914 (the year Chaplin made his first movie) Calvero (Chaplin), once a famous stage clown who has lost both his comedic charm and his audience, meets a depressed young ballet dancer named Thereza (Bloom), and together, they find meaning and hope in life. Along with Chaplin's \textit{The Circus} (1928), this is Chaplin's most autobiographical film, about his own fears of losing his audience. Very moving, this is Chaplin's last great film. \author{AW}

Joe, a hired ``looper'' assassin, realizes they want to terminate his contract when he finds his older self sent back to him. A smart, thoroughly enjoyable, and original time travel sci-fi action thriller that takes a while to wrap your head around. Has a few moments, though, that feel unconnected from the rest of the plot. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

A poignant and profound portrait of frienship, culture shock, and coping with feelings of loneliness and emptiness. Murray and Johansson's shared scenes are often witty and always touching. A good sophomore effort by Sofia Coppola. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}
