\movie{Bambi}{1942}{70m}{\four} \dir{David Hand; James Algar; Samuel Armstrong; Graham Heid; Bill Roberts; Paul Satterfield; Norman Wright} The third theatrical Disney film tells the story of Bambi, a white-tailed deer, and his life as a fawn and growing up. The menacing ``Man'' that hunts the forest, evoked first through the Jaws-like chromatic theme, is undeniably chilling and villainous, perhaps made more so by being unseen. Great music by Frank Churchill and Edward Plumb. The film contains less than a thousand lines of dialogue, and is conveyed mostly through beautiful animation and music. \author{AW}

\movie{Batman Begins}{2005}{140m}{\three} \dir{Christopher Nolan} \cast{Christian Bale; Michael Caine; Liam Neeson; Katie Holmes; Gary Oldman; Cillian Murphy} After his parents' death in a senseless crime, young Bruce Wayne is plagued by guilt, believing he is at fault. He faces his fears and becomes the Batman, a masked crusader whose aim is to bring crime-ridden Gotham City back from the brink of destruction. Interesting and satisfying prequel to the Batman saga is well shot, well acted, and sets the dark, brooding mood for the rest of the trilogy. Followed by \textit{The Dark Knight}. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Beasts of the Southern Wild}{2012}{93m}{\four} \dir{Benh Zeitlin} \cast{Quvenzhan\'e Wallis; Dwight Henry; Levy Easterly; Lowell Landes} Six-year-old Hushpuppy and her father struggle to survive in their poor bayou community after a vicious flood. Despite her decaying community and her father's worsening health, Hushpuppy develops a courageous, heroic view of life. Excellent independent drama which tells a universal story about human nature and survival, and the power of imagination. Newcomers Wallis and Henry are outstanding in their roles. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Beauty and the Beast}{1991}{84m}{\three} \dir{Gary Trousdale; Kirk Wise} \cast{Paige O'Hara; Richard White; Jerry Orbach; David Odgen Stiers} Belle, whose father is imprisoned by the Beast, offers herself instead and discovers her captor to be an enchanted prince. This entry in Disney's Renaissance period looks back to many of the studio's past achievements, and is certainly reminiscent of \textit{Cinderella} (1950). After 30+ years, the old Disney formula (marriage of memorable songs, music, and bright animation) really works. Music is quite ``Broadway'', and the movie is slightly dense with songs. Great use of the new CAPS digital multiplane. Special edition is 91m. \author{AW} \mpaa{G}

\movie{Big Lebowski, The}{1998}{117m}{\three} \dir{Joel and Ethan Coen} \cast{Jeff Bridges; John Goodman; Julianne Moore; Steve Buscemi; Philip Seymour Hoffman; Tara Reid} Jeffrey Lebowski, the Dude, mistaken for a millionaire Lebowski, is attacked by two strangers and has his living room rug stolen. The Dude gets caught up in a whodunit when the ``Big'' Lebowski seeks him for help. He eventually traces a series of clues that lead to nowhere. He is taken advantage of in almost every way, mostly due to his unemployed slacker status, when all he wants is his rug. A very entertaining comedy by the Coens, vastly underappreciated by critics. \author{AW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Birds, The}{1963}{119m}{\threehalf} \dir{Alfred Hitchcock} \cast{Tippi Hedren; Rod Taylor; Jessica Tandy; Veronica Cartwright; Suzanne Pleshette; Ethel Griffies; Charles McGraw} A San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small town that becomes victim to bird attacks of escalating size and viciousness. Suspense builds in this horror film that turns birds into terrifying savage villians. The lack of a musical score creates an eerie tension throughout. Also notable is the film's ambiguous, inconclusive ending. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13, 1984}

\movie{Blades of Glory}{2007}{93m}{\twohalf} \dir{Josh Gordon; Will Speck} \cast{Will Ferrell; Jon Heder; Will Arnett; Amy Poehler; Jenna Fischer; William Fichtner; Craig T. Nelson} After being banned from the sport, two male figure skaters exploit a loophole and pair up so they can continue to compete. Enjoyable comedy with some funny scenes and spirited performances from Ferrell and Heder. However, the plot falls flat as do some of the jokes. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Blind Side, The}{2009}{129m}{\twohalf} \dir{John Lee Hancock} \cast{Sandra Bullock; Tim McGraw; Quinton Aaron; Kathy Bates; Lily Collins; Jae Head; Ray McKinnon} Based on the true story of Michael Oher, a homeless boy who becomes a football star with the help of a caring woman who raises him as family. This heartwarming drama is entertaining, with an impressive performance by Bullock, but is superficial and almost melodramatic in its treatment of the story. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}
