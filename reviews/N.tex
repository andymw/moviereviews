\movie{Network}{1976}{121m}{\four} \dir{Sidney Lumet} \cast{Faye Dunaway; William Holden; Peter Finch; Robert Duvall; Wesley Addy; Ned Beatty; Beatrice Straight} A TV network striving for higher ratings cynically exploits a deranged news anchor's ravings and revelations about the media for their own profit. A brilliant satire on television media in the 1970s that is a timely portrait of media today. Paddy Chayefsky's dialogue-driven screenplay is brought to life with gusto through bravura performances from nearly every cast member. The network's exaggerated situations are simultaneously hilarious and prophetic; a great movie from a great decade of cinema. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}
