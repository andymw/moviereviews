\movie{Fahrenheit 451}{1966}{112m}{\twohalf} \dir{Fran\c{c}ois Truffaut} \cast{Oskar Werner; Julie Christie; Cyril Cusack; Anton Diffring; Jeremy Spenser} In an oppressive future society, a ``fireman'' whose job is to burn all books begins to question his task. Meandering and lackluster adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic novel. The acting feels somewhat melodramatic, and the film is somewhat lacking in plot. Probably more effective when it was released, it doesn't stand the test of time. \author{DW}

Russell} \cast{Mark Wahlberg; Christian Bale; Amy Adams; Melissa Leo; Jack McGee; Frank Renzulli; Mickey O'Keefe} A look at the early years of boxer ``Irish'' Micky Ward and his brother who helped him train before going pro in the mid 1980s. A captivating, entertaining boxing drama with exceptional performances from its ensemble cast, especially Bale.

A delightful, exciting, family-friendly adventure film from Pixar Animation Studios. Its colorful (literally) cast of characters is diverse and memorable. Re-released as \textit{Finding Nemo 3D} in 2012. \author{DW} \mpaa{G}

\movie{Fish Called Wanda, A}{1988}{108m}{\three} \dir{Charles Crichton} \cast{John Cleese; Jamie Lee Curtis; Kevin Kline; Michael Palin; Maria Aitken; Tome Georgeson; Patricia Hayes} In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to doublecross each other for thse loot. Funny and entertaining heist-comedy with memorable characters, quick pacing, and a farcical plot. Kevin Kline's Best Supporting Actor-winning performance as Otto is hilarious and unforgettable. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}
