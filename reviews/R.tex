\movie{Rat Race}{2001}{112m}{\twohalf} \dir{Jerry Zucker} \cast{John Cleese; Breckin Meyer; Amy Smart; Rowan Atkinson; Whoopi Goldberg; Cuba Gooding, Jr.; Seth Green; Vince Vieluf} A Las Vegas casino magnate, determined to find a new avenue for wagering, sets up a race where six teams of people go after \$2 million in Silver City, New Mexico. Zany, over-the-top, and for the most part funny farce is a loose remake of \textit{It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World}. Consists mostly of sight gags; some are laughable, some are not. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Ratatouille}{2007}{111m}{\threehalf} \dir{Brad Bird; Jan Pinkava} \cast{Patton Oswalt; Lou Romano; Janeane Garofalo; Ian Holm; Peter O'Toole; Brad Garrett; Brian Dennehy; Peter Sohn} With dreams of becoming a chef, Remy, an unusual rat with a talent for cooking, makes an unlikely alliance with a young kitchen worker at a famed Paris restaurant. Well-made and thoroughly enjoyable story of friendship and ambition with good humor, engaging voice acting and stellar animation, as always, from Pixar Studios. \author{DW} \mpaa{G}

\movie{Rear Window}{1954}{112m}{\threehalf} \dir{Alfred Hitchcock} \cast{James Stewart; Grace Kelly; Wendell Corey; Thelma Ritter; Raymond Burr; Judith Evelyn} A wheelchair-bound photographer spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them has committed murder. An entertaining, suspenseful, and technically well-made Hitchcock classic, with a memorable performance by Stewart. The climactic last 20 minutes are the highlight of the film. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG, 1983}

\movie{Right Stuff, The}{1983}{193m}{\four} \dir{Philip Kaufman} \cast{Sam Shepard; Scott Glenn; Ed Harris; Fred Ward; Dennis Quaid; Barbara Hershey} The film opens in 1947 with Chuck Yeager (Shepard) breaking the sound barrier in the rocket-powered Bell X-1 in a thrilling sequence, and ends in 1963 with Gordo Cooper (Quaid) making 22 orbits around the Earth in his Mercury capsule. Along the way, we get a glimpse of the lives of these test pilots and Mercury astronauts, and the political undertones behind the manned space program. The film deliberately plays down the achievements of the original Mercury astronauts, and suggests that the original test pilots are the ones truly made of the ``right stuff''. This movie is a spectacular and ambitious American epic. \author{AW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Room, The}{2003}{99m}{\one} \dir{Tommy Wiseau} \cast{Tommy Wiseau; Juliette Danielle; Greg Sestero; Philip Haldiman; Carolyn Minnott; Robyn Paris; Mike Holmes} A happy-go-lucky banker sees his world fall apart when he is involved in a love triangle with his fianc\'ee and best friend, and everyone begins to betray him one by one. \textit{The Room}, written, directed, and produced single-handedly by Wiseau, is a barrage of bad acting, laughably incompetent dialogue, and numerous overt continuity goofs. Entertaining in an ``it's so bad it's good'' kind of way, the film has gained a cult following. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Rope}{1948}{80m}{\three} \dir{Alfred Hitchcock} \cast{James Stewart; John Dall; Farley Granger; Douglas Dick; Joan Chandler; Cedric Hardwicke; Constance Collier} Two young men murder their classmate, hide the body in a trunk, and invite his friends and family to a dinner party as a means to challenge the ``perfection'' of their crime. Made to appear as if it was shot in one take, this is a cinematic experiment that is entertaining and suspenseful. Originally a play by Patrick Hamilton, \textit{Rope} is a story, however, that perhaps is better told in the intimacy of a stage environment. \author{DW}
