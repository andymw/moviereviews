\movie{Accepted}{2006}{92m}{\two} \dir{Steve Pink} \cast{Justin Long; Jonah Hill; Blake Lively; Anthony Heald; Lewis Black; Travis Van Winkle; Diora Baird} A high school slacker who's rejected from every school he applied to creates his own university, the South Harmon Institute of Technology, on a rundown piece of property near his home. This teen comedy has its laughs, but a ludicrous plot and cast of characters make the film hard to enjoy as a whole. To some extent, it glorifies the students' lackadaisical attitude toward education. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Airplane!}{1980}{88m}{\threehalf} \dir{Jim Abrahams; David Zucker; Jerry Zucker} \cast{Robert Hays; Julie Hagerty; Leslie Nielsen; Peter Graves; Lloyd Bridges; Robert Stack; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar; Lorna Patterson} Passangers and crew on a commercial airliner take ill, and the only person capable of landing the plane is an ex-pilot afraid to fly. Hilarious spoof of disaster films is filled with memorable one-liners, sight gags, and pop-culture references. Silly and juvenile comedy at its very best! \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

A dark and complex, but often amusing satire on American suburban life and an exploration of sexuality, beauty, conformity, and redemption.

\movie{Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy}{2004}{94m}{\three} \dir{Adam McKay} \cast{Will Ferrell; Christina Applegate; Paul Rudd; David Koechner; Steve Carell; Fred Willard; Chris Parnell} Ron Burgundy is the top rated newsman in 1970s San Diego, but when a new, ambitious female anchor comes aboard, he finds his position threatened. This much-quoted comedy is crude and silly, but manages to be genuinely funny and entertaining thanks to its strong performances and ludicrous story. Unrated version runs 98m. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Angels \& Demons}{2009}{138m}{\twohalf} \dir{Ron Howard} \cast{Tom Hanks; Ewan McGregor; Ayelet Zurer; Stellan Skarsg\aa rd; Pierfrancesco Favino; Nikolaj Lie Kaas} Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon travels to the Vatican to solve a series of murders and prevent a terrorist attack. Mediocre adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling thriller is entertaining, but forgettable. Film has many picturesque shots of the Vatican, but does not deliver the intellectual satisfaction that comes from the novel. Extended cut runs 146m. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

Ben Affleck directs and stars in this excellent fast-paced thriller. Tense and exciting, but often very funny, \textit{Argo} succeeds largely due to its excellent cast and the connections the moviegoer will inevitably form with each of the characters. Won Oscar for Best Picture. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Avengers, The}{2012}{143m}{\three} \dir{Joss Whedon} \cast{Robert Downey, Jr.; Chris Evans; Mark Ruffalo; Chris Hemsworth; Scarlett Johansson; Tom Hiddleston; Samuel L. Jackson} Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans and forms The Avengers, to protect the Earth from evil Loki and his army. A well-made and thoroughly entertaining superhero film, that despite its big-budget action scenes, still takes the time for us to get to know each of the Marvel heroes. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}
