\movie{Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}{2002}{161m}{\three} \dir{Chris Columbus} \cast{Daniel Radcliffe; Emma Watson; Rupert Grint; Robbie Coltrane; Kenneth Branagh; Maggie Smith; Alan Rickman} Harry returns for a second year to find Hogwarts plagued by mysterious attacks linked to the legendary Chamber of Secrets hidden within the school. A darker film then \textit{Sorcerer's Stone}, Chris Columbus' second Potter film still manages to bring the charms of Rowling's series. Extended version runs 174m. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part One}{2010}{146m}{\threehalf} \dir{David Yates} \cast{Daniel Radcliffe; Emma Watson; Rupert Grint; Helena Bonham Carter; Rhys Ifans} Harry, Ron, and Hermione track horcruxes across the British countryside and discover the existence of three exceedingly powerful objects: the Deathly Hallows. The most introspective Potter film focuses extensively on the internal struggles of its three young heroes, and is a welcome change-of-pace for the series. Another highlight is the animated telling of the ``Deathly Hallows'' tale, narrated by Watson. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part Two}{2011}{130m}{\three} \dir{David Yates} \cast{Daniel Radcliffe; Emma Watson; Rupert Grint; Ralph Fiennes; Alan Rickman; John Hurt; Maggie Smith} Final Potter film chronicles the trio's search for the last horcruxes and the climactic final battle between Harry and Voldemort. An enjoyable and satisfying end to the series with an excellent performance by Alan Rickman, but there are several changes from the novel and the film focuses a bit too much on action sequences. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}{2005}{157m}{\twohalf} \dir{Mike Newell} \cast{Daniel Radcliffe; Emma Watson; Rupert Grint; Robert Pattinson; David Tennant; Ralph Fiennes} Harry is entered as a competitor in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, and Lord Voldemort returns to power. Probably the most overrated film in the Potter series, \textit{Goblet} lacks the character development and subtle humor of the first films, instead focusing on big-budget action sequences. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}{2009}{153m}{\three} \dir{David Yates} \cast{Daniel Radcliffe; Emma Watson; Rupert Grint; Michael Gambon; Alan Rickman; Tom Felton; Jim Broadbent} Harry learns more about Lord Voldemort's dark past and he and Dumbledore begin the quest for horcruxes to finally destroy the Dark Lord. One of the funniest Potter films, \textit{Prince} still has plenty of dark, brooding scenes, especially its tearjerking finale, though it tends to deviate from Rowling's novel. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}{2007}{138m}{\three} \dir{David Yates} \cast{Daniel Radcliffe; Emma Watson; Rupert Grint; Brendan Gleeson; Imelda Staunton; Helena Bonham Carter} With their warning about Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Ministry of Magic, while a new authoritarian staff member seizes power at Hogwarts. Great performances by Gleeson and Staunton as foil characters ``Mad-Eye'' Moody and Dolores Umbridge, and a good Potter film overall. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}{2004}{141m}{\threehalf} \dir{Alfonso Cuar\'on} \cast{Daniel Radcliffe; Emma Watson; Rupert Grint; Michael Gambon; Gary Oldman; David Thewlis; Robbie Coltrane} In Harry's third year, convicted murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison and is coming after Harry, while dark dementors surround the Hogwarts castle. Cuar\'on brings his distinctive directorial style to the maturing series. Excellent use of time motif throughout the film, the best of the Potter saga. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone}{2001}{152m}{\three} \dir{Chris Columbus} \cast{Daniel Radcliffe; Emma Watson; Rupert Grint; Robbie Coltrane; Maggie Smith; Alan Rickman; Richard Harris; Ian Hart} The adventures of 11-year-old boy-wizard Harry at Hogwarts school, where he befriends Ron and Hermione and learns about Lord Voldemort and his own dark past. A delightful film that faithfully translates author J.K. Rowling's vision to the screen. Good performances and direction by Columbus, with a charming score by John Williams. Extended version runs 159m. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Help, The}{2011}{146m}{\twohalf} \dir{Tate Taylor} \cast{Emma Stone; Viola Davis; Bryce Dallas Howard; Octavia Spencer; Jessica Chastain} In the 1960s south, an aspiring author decides to write a book from the perspective of the African-American maids who work for white families, detailing their daily hardships and struggles. A heartfelt and sensitive drama about race relations, the film is a little overlong and focuses on too many characters. However, Davis gives an excellent performance not soon to be forgotten. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{Hero}{2002-Chinese}{99m}{\threehalf} \dir{Yimou Zhang} \cast{Jet Li; Tony Leung; Maggie Cheung; Ziyi Zhang; Daoming Chen; Donnie Yen} A nameless warrior defeats three assassins who sought to murder the Qin Emperor in pre-unified China. A fantastically colorful take on the \textit{wuxia} genre, \textit{Hero} presents a sometimes mediative, occasionally melodramatic tale of the struggle for sovereignty in the face of greater need. Dazzling cinematography rarely falls flat as the color-coded sections play out, each evoking a different aspect of the story told by Nameless. Mandarin title is \textit{Y\=\i ngxi\'ong}. \author{JDT} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{How the Grinch Stole Christmas}{2000}{104m}{\onehalf} \dir{Ron Howard} \cast{Jim Carrey; Taylor Momsen; Jeffrey Tambor; Frank Welker; Christine Baranski; Bill Irwin; Molly Shannon} Adaptation of Dr.\ Seuss' classic about a green, curmudgeonly creature intent on stealing Christmas from Whoville. This big-budget remake is watchable and at times entertaining, but is missing the good old-fashioned Christmas spirit of the original 1966 TV special. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Hugo}{2011}{126m}{\threehalf} \dir{Martin Scorsese} \cast{Asa Butterfield; Ben Kingsley; Sacha Baron Cohen; Chlo\"e Grace Moretz; Ray Winstone} An orphan boy living in a 1930s Paris train station unravels a mystery involving an automaton, leading him to the retired film director Georges M\'eli\`es. Scorsese's first children's film is just as enjoyable for adults---a delightfule tale with a colorful set, excellent cast, and a sense of magic and wonder that's sadly not found in most children's movies today. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Hunger Games, The}{2012}{142m}{\three} \dir{Gary Ross} \cast{Jennifer Lawrence; Josh Hutcherson; Liam Hemsworth; Woody Harrelson; Elizabeth Banks; Lenny Kravitz} Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games, an annual fight-to-the-death between children from each of the twelve districts of the oppressive nation of Panem. A faithful adaptation of its source material and a good action thriller whose highlights include the excellent acting of its youthful cast and elaborate imaginative set design. From the novel by Suzanne Collins. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}
