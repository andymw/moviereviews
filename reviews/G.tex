Niccol's directorial d\'ebut has a rich and original story, posing interesting and important questions about science and ethics.

This raunchy, crude comedy is entertaining, but many of its cheap slapstick and gross-out gags are too over-the-top to be funny. Brand gives a decent performance as the crazy rocker Aldous Snow. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Great Gatsby, The}{2013}{143m}{\three} \dir{Baz Luhrmann} \cast{Leonardo DiCaprio; Tobey Maguire; Carey Mulligan; Joel Edgerton; Isla Fisher; Jason Clarke; Elizabeth Debicki} Adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel in which WWI veteran Nick Carraway finds himself drawn to the past and lavish lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor Gatsby. A visually stunning film, with impressive costume design and a strong cast, it is as enjoyable as the book. However, the anachronism of Roaring '20s parties against 21\st\ century hip-hop music feels inappropriate and inconsistent. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}
