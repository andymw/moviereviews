\movie{Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The}{1974}{104m}{\three} \dir{Joseph Sargent} \cast{Walter Matthau; Robert Shaw; Martin Balsam; Hector Elizondo; Earl Hindman} Four armed men hijack a New York City subway car and demand one million ransom for the passengers to be paid within an hour. Exciting and well-made thriller laced with darkly comedic one-liners. Great performances from Matthau and Shaw, but today the film loses some of the realism and impact it would have had in the 1970s. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Terminal, The}{2004}{128m}{\three} \dir{Steven Spielberg} \cast{Tom Hanks; Catherine Zeta-Jones; Stanley Tucci; Chi McBride; Diego Luna} An eastern European traveler is forced to take up residence in New York's JFK airport after a coup d'\'etat in his home country. A lighthearted and funny romantic comedy with themes of home, family, and friendship. Hanks makes a quite convincing (and entertaining) foreigner. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{There Will Be Blood}{2007}{158m}{\four} \dir{Paul Thomas Anderson} \cast{Daniel Day-Lewis; Paul Dano; Dillon Freasier; Russell Harvard; Kevin J. O'Connor} This tale of greed, corruption, family, and religion follows ``oil man'' Daniel Plainview's ruthless quest for wealth in early 20\th-century California. With excellent performances by Day-Lewis and Dano and a haunting score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, this masterpiece film is enthralling from start to finish! Notable cinematography includes long takes and creative transitional shots. From the novel \textit{Oil!}\ by Upton Sinclair. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Third Man, The}{1949}{93m}{\fourplus} \dir{Carol Reed} \cast{Orsen Welles; Joseph Cotten; Orsen Welles; Alida Valli; Trevor Howard} Holly Martins (Cotten) travels to postwar Vienna, and finds himself investigating a mysterious death of an old friend. Features a very catchy score by Austrian zither player Anton Karas. Robert Krasker provides stylistic expressionist cinematography, including unorthodox angles and harsh contrasts. Winner of the Grand Prix at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival, \textit{The Third Man} is one of the most outstanding film-noirs. \author{AW}

\movie{Time After Time}{1979}{112m}{\twohalf} \dir{Nicholas Meyer} \cast{Malcolm McDowell; David Warner; Mary Steenburgen; Charles Cioffi; Kent Williams; Patti D'Arbanville} Jack the Ripper uses H.G. Wells' fictional time machine to escape to the 20\th\ century; Wells follows in pursuit. A quirky, fun and often amusing sci-fi adventure has good performances from its three leads, but isn't particularly memorable. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Trail of the Pink Panther}{1982}{96m}{\onehalf} \dir{Blake Edwards} \cast{Peter Sellers; David Niven; Herbert Lom; Joanna Lumley; Burt Kwouk; Robert Loggia} The Pink Panther diamond is stolen once again, and Clouseau is called on case while he is trailed by a mob who are seeking to assassinate him. Seventh film in the series is made after Sellers' death, his performance pieced togehther from outtakes and archive footage. Funny slapstick scenes are too loosely connected (by what can hardly be considered a plot) to make an enjoyable film. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Twilight}{2008}{122m}{\onehalf} \dir{Catherine Hardwicke} \cast{Kristen Stewart; Robert Pattinson; Peter Facinelli; Elizabeth Reaser; Ashley Greene; Kellan Lutz; Nikke Reed} A teenage girl risks everything when she falls in love with a vampire. Melodramatic and poorly acted adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's best-selling young-adult novel. With weak characters and a weak plotline, this film is likely to bore anyone except fans of the book series. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}
