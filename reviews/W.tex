\movie{WALL$\cdot$E}{2008}{98m}{\four} \dir{Andrew Stanton} \cast{Ben Burtt; Elissa Knight; Jeff Garlin; Fred Willard; John Ratzenberger; Kathy Najimy; Sigourney Weaver} In the distant future, when garbage litters the Earth and humans are exiled from the planet, a small, waste-collecting robot embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind. Visionary film from Pixar Animation Studios that is both an entertaining adventure and a cautionary tale of the negative impact humans have on the Earth. One of the few children's films that's a technical masterpiece in its own right. \author{DW} \mpaa{G}

\movie{War Horse}{2011}{146m}{\three} \dir{Steven Spielberg} \cast{Jeremy Irvine; Emily Watson; David Thewlis; Peter Mullan; Niels Arestrup; Benedict Cumberbatch; Tom Hiddleston} Young Albert enlists to serve in WWI after his beloved horse is sold to the cavalry. His hopeful journey brings him to the front lines as the war wages on. A heartwarming war film of grand, epic scope that's well shot and acted. Perhaps it should have been more narratively challenging and focus more on the war itself, but nonetheless it's a success. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG-13}

\movie{White Christmas}{1954}{120m}{\three} \dir{Michael Curtiz} \cast{Bing Crosby; Danny Kaye; Rosemary Clooney; Vera-Ellen; Dean Jagger} Successful song-and-dance team Wallace and Davis become romantically linked with a sister act and team up to save the failing Vermont inn of their former army general. Delightfully warmhearted, if overly sentimental Christmas story, with memorable songs and some great dance numbers by Bing Crosby and the bunch. \author{DW}

\movie{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}{1988}{104m}{\three} \dir{Robert Zemeckis} \cast{Bob Hoskins; Charles Fleischer; Christopher Lloyd; Joanna Cassidy; Kathleen Turner; Alan Tilvern; Stubby Kaye} In a world where cartoon characters and humans coexist, private-eye Eddie Valiant sets out to prove Roger's innocence in a murder case. A technically exellent blend of live-action and animation (featuring Warner Bros.\ and Disney characters appearing together for the first time) that's funny, original, and deceptively adult, but some scenes are a little too theatrical and ``cartoonish.'' \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}

\movie{Wild Bunch, The}{1969}{145m}{\threehalf} \dir{Sam Peckinpah} \cast{William Holden; Ernest Borgnine; Robert Ryan; Edmond O'Brien; Warren Oates; Jaime S\'anchez} Classic Western about an aging gang of outlaws trying to survive in the age when the ``traditional'' West is disappearing all around them. This exciting film was groundbreaking in 1969 for its slow-motion sequences and graphic, on-screen violence, and is still effective today. As the film goes on, we empathize with the titular ``wild bunch,'' which makes the brutal finale all the more shocking. \author{DW} \mpaa{R}

\movie{Wreck-It Ralph}{2012}{101m}{\three} \dir{Rich Moore} \cast{John C. Reilly; Sarah Silverman; Jack McBrayer; Jane Lynch; Alan Tudyk; Mindy Kaling} A video game villain longing to be a good guy sets out to fulfill his dream and befriends a sprightly outcast from another game. Funny and enjoyable family adventure-comedy is well-animated in a variety of video game graphics styles, and carries a meaningful theme of accepting oneself for who you are. Its references to the retro era of arcade games will keep adults entertained along with the kids. \author{DW} \mpaa{PG}
